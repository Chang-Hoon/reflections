How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   "FC" in Windows7 shows me the differences between files with line number(s).

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    It'd be easier to roll back to previous when there is any mistakes or to compare with.
    
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It'd be more making sense to get related files together updated and get remarked whenever there is an update.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    git diff first_id second_id
    git log

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    I'd be confortable to getting back previous commits as long as I want when there is any bug introduced.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use git as my main source code repository in my daily business.
