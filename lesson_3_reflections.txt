When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I want to sync with other developers' updates more frequently.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I need to work on my own local files while I'm confident they can be merged with remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks: make another copy of the repo on my GitHub.
	clones: make a local copy from GitHub or the other local repo.
	branches: make a label to work with.
