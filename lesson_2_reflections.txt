What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?
	A hidden directoy named '.git' is created. It is needed to initialize the git set up.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area keeps files to be committed onto repository as a logical group while working directly has files which are on-going or not included in the logical group (work package).
	It is handy for separating tasks logically and maintain correcly on git.
